# Shiny example

This example is a small [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application. The starter uses [Dockerfile](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/docker) to deploy the app. Read more about containerizing Shiny apps [here](https://hosting.analythium.io/dockerized-shiny-apps-with-dependencies/). Make sure that Shiny is using the `PORT` environment variable for the Shiny port.
